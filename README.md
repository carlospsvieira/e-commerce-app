# E-Commerce App (Vite + React)

##### Intro:
Inspired by an e-commerce app built recently in school, this time I decided to go for Vite + React instead of React-Create-App. <br>
I created my own products .json file to simulate a store with four different clothing categories. <br>
I also applied react-bootstrap to speed up the styling process, and managed states with the useContext hook.



#### Technologies:
